Senior Project @ Oregon Tech<br>
Professor: Calvin Caldwell<br>
Student: Joshua Hardy<br>

Emulator functionally plays Space Invaders with Sound

This is one of my first large projects. I chose the 8080 emulator because I wanted to show the depth
of my knowledge gained from school, from the basic bit banging to higher level OOP concepts.

How to run:<br>
Make sure Java runtime is installed.<br>
Download the Emulator.jar and run with java -jar Emulator.jar OR double click on Emulator.jar<br>
<a href="https://github.com/jshardy/8080-Emulator/blob/master/Emulator.jar">Emulator.jar Download</a> 

 <br>Select Play/Pause, use arrow buttons to navigate and space bar to shoot.
