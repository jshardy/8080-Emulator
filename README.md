# 8080-Emulator written in Java.
This is my Senior Project @ Oregon Tech<br>
Professor: Calvin Caldwell<br>
Author: Joshua Hardy<br>

Emulator functionally plays Space Invaders without sound.

This is one of my first large projects. I chose the 8080 emulator because I wanted to show the depth
of my knowledge gained from school, from the basic bit banging to higher level OOP concepts.

How to run:<br>
    Make sure Java runtime is installed
    Download the Emulator.jar and run with java -jar Emulator.jar or double click on Emulator.jar<br>
    <br><b>On Windows sometimes the window doesn't properly size itself, resize it, or restart the Emulator</b>
    <br>Select Play/Pause, use arrow buttons to navigate and space bar to shoot.
    
<br>TODO: Debug Bar resize is wrong
<br>TODO: Replace buttons with play/pause, restart, and step
<br>TODO: Memory display
<br>TODO: Redo GUI in JavaFX
<br>TODO: Add threaded sound
