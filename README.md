# 8080-Emulator written in Java.
This is my Senoir Project @ Oregon Tech<br>
Professor: Calvin Caldwell<br>
Author: Joshua Hardy<br>

Emulator functionally plays Space Invaders without sound.

This is one of my first large projects. I learned a lot.
I chose the 8080 emulator because I wanted to show the depth
of my knowledge gained from school, from the basic bit
banging to higher level OOP concepts.

How to run:<br>
    Download the Jarfile and run with java -jar Emulator.jar<br>
