# 8080-Emulator written in Java.
This is my Senoir Project @ Oregon Tech
Professor: Calvin Caldwell
Author: Joshua Hardy

Emulator functionally plays Space Invaders without sound.

This is one of my first large projects. I learned a lot.
I chose the 8080 emulator because I wanted to show the depth
of my knowledge gained from school, from the basics to bit
banging to more advanced OOP concepts.

What I learned:
-I can now count in hex/binary in my head, something I could
not do without a pencil before. All the concepts from
architecture classes were absolutely useful!

-My mental model of how machine language works is reinforced
with a real world exercise. No guess work, I understand whats
going on behind those CALL or RET functions.

-I need to work on architecture/patterns A LOT! My OOP did
not come out how I envisioned it would and in my opinion is
poorly done. Example, see massive case statement in CPU.java.
